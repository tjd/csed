To run, download examclock.jar, double-click it and then follow the instructions.

The start-up can be a little slow, so be patient.

You can put personalized messages in the files earlyMessages.txt and lateMessages.txt (put
them in the same directory as the .jar file). Put one message per line, as many lines as you
like, and then the clock will cycle through all the messages while it is running.

If you don't use one or both of the files, then a series of default messages will be used.
