The Board.py and starter.py programs were used in a the final project
for CMPT 120 in Fall 2006 at SFU Surrey. The project was to write a
program to simulate the spread of forest fires, and the Board class
was provided for easy graphics. The starter.py program was used in
lieu of detailed documentation.

Board.py is quite generic and could be used for many different kinds
of projects, e.g. board games, cellular automaton, etc.

The folder "project_philip_peach_thomas_cheung" contains a superb
implementation of the CMPT 120 Fall 2006 project. In addition to the
basic requirements, it includes special graphics, and animated
helicopters that come out and douse fires. Philip has given
permission via email to include this project under the GPL v2.
