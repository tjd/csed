= Introduction =

The following documents the language-neutral architecture for Jabber chatbot clients.
Currently Python and Java clients are planned, but this design should be implementable in
any programming language with Jabber support.

= Major Design Goals =

The chatbot client should support these features:

 * It should be easy to create a new chatbot, and then in a few lines of code set up a
working Jabber connection. 
 * In addition to on-line Jabber chatting, a plug-in will be provided that allows users to
easily chat locally for testing purposes.
 * Logging of transcripts.


= Python-specific Details =

The [http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/ xmppy] library looks reasonable, although the
documentation is not great.

= Java-specific Details =

In the past, we've used the [http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/ Smack library] for Java
support, and it still seems like a good choice.
