#labels Phase-Design
Design document for chatbots.

= Introduction =

The following documents an object-oriented architecture for Jabber chatbot clients.
Currently Python and Java clients are planned, but this design is intended to be implementable in any programming language with Jabber support.

= Major Design Goals =

The chatbot client should support these features:

  * It should be as easy as possible for beginners (i.e. students in CMPT 120/125) to create a new chatbot, and then in a few lines of code set up a working Jabber connection.
  * In addition to on-line Jabber chatting, it should also be easy for users to chat locally for testing purposes.
  * One of the supplied chatbots lets the user chat with other Jabber users. This can be  the basis of both a regular human chat client, or as a testing tool when combined with the local server proxy in the previous point.  
  * Transcript logging. By default, every chat sessions's sent and received messages are appended to the text file `jabberlog.txt`.

= Main Classes =

== JabberServerProxyBase ==

Classes for chatting on a Jabber server, or locally to the computer user, will extend this
class.

== JabberClientBase ==

New Jabber clients will extend this class.

= Python-specific Details =

The [http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/ xmppy] library looks reasonable, although the
documentation is not great.

= Java-specific Details =

In the past, we've used the [http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/ Smack library] for Java
support, and it still seems like a good choice.
