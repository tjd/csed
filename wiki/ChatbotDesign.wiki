#labels Phase-Design
Design document for chatbots.

= Introduction =

The following documents the language-neutral architecture for Jabber chatbot clients.
Currently Python and Java clients are planned, but this design should be implementable in
any programming language with Jabber support.

= Major Design Goals =

The chatbot client should support these features:

  * It should be easy to create a new chatbot, and then in a few lines of code set up a working Jabber connection. 
  * In addition to on-line Jabber chatting, a module that allows users to easily chat locally for testing purposes.
  * Transcript logging.

(The [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=14&can=2&q=wiki problem with long
lines in bullet lists] is in the Google code support issue tracker.)

= Main Classes =

== JabberServerProxyBase ==

Classes for chatting on a Jabber server, or locally to the computer user, will extend this
class.

== JabberClientBase ==

New Jabber clients will extend this class.

= Python-specific Details =

The [http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/ xmppy] library looks reasonable, although the
documentation is not great.

= Java-specific Details =

In the past, we've used the [http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/ Smack library] for Java
support, and it still seems like a good choice.
