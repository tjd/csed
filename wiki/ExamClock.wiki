To run, download examclock.jar from [http://code.google.com/p/csed/ the main page], double-click it and then follow the instructions.

The start-up can be a little slow, so be patient.

You can put personalized messages in the files `earlyMessages.txt` and `lateMessages.txt` (put them in the same directory as the .jar file). Put one message per line, as many lines as you like, and then the clock will cycle through all the messages while it is running.

If one or both of the message files are missing, then a set of default messages will be used.
