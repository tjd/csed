         Global darkness shortage poses health and sanity risk
        </h3>
        There's a global shortage of darkness, and it's not good for us.

<blockquote>
 "A number of health and environmental problems are due to a loss of darkness," says Dr David Crawford, executive director of the International Dark-Sky Association, a group that campaigns against light pollution. "And it will get worse as we creep -- or rush -- to a 24/7 world. All of life, all of it, has evolved with a day/night cycle -- the circadian rhythm. It's essential to good health. Many studies are now showing that those who go without a true day/night cycle are adversely impacting their immune systems, and that's not good..."
 <p>

 Once at work, overriding the craving for dark and sleep comes at a price. "They activate the `fight or flight' stress mechanism," says Foster, "and we know that stress in turn can suppress the immune system." Bright lights, caffeine and nicotine artificially maintain stimulation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, studies show that nightshift workers are at increased risk of a range of health problems, from stress, constipation and stomach ulcers to depression, heart disease and cancer. For example, a 2001 study in Seattle, based on interviews with 800 women, found that females who worked the graveyard shift could face a 60 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer.

         Disney busts amateur Disneyland tour guide
        </h3>
        Jim Hill is one of the great Disnephiles and Disney bloggers of the planet. Among other things, he gives a regular tour of Disneyland to people who pay him to show them around and tell them the inside story of the park (there are <em>tons</em> of tour operators who show people around Disney parks -- often escorting large groups from other countries). This weekend, Disney security stopped and threatened to arrest Jim for giving his tour. 


<blockquote>

I'm serious, folks. 20 minutes into my 2 o'clock tour, I was suddenly interrupted by two officials from the park's security staff. They quietly pulled me aside and said that they'd had complaints about my tour. That they'd heard that I was saying negative things about their theme park. More importantly, that my JHM tour was somehow undercutting Disneyland Guest Relations' ability to sell its own tours of the theme park.
<p>
Needless to say, I was somewhat surprised by this reaction. As were the 10 or so people who were taking my 2 o'clock tour and watching all of this unfold from 5 feet away. I mean, yes, the JHM Disneyland tour does contain a few juicy stories. Which is why Chuck Oberleitner once called it "The 'E' True Hollywood version of Disneyland's history." But is that really reason enough to shut the tour down?

         Bloggers = Journalists? Visa restrictions may be a downside.
        </h3>
        <a href="http://www.corante.com/importance/">Ernest Miller</a> says,

<blockquote>
A couple of days ago BoingBoing <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/19/dont_say_blogger_to_.html">posted a story</a> about the harrassment Jeremy Wright, who is Canadian, faced when he told US Immigration officials that he was a blogger. Although it is unclear why he was treated so poorly by US government officials, one possible explanation is that, as a blogger, he is also a journalists. Journalists, even from friendly countries, are required to have special "I Visas" that normal tourists are not required to have. Journalists without these visas have beeen similarly harrassed. Maybe we ought to change that law.</blockquote>

<p>His nose looked like a penis. Not 'kind of like a penis'; it looked like a urologically-correct appendage, right down to what we believe is called the dorsal vein."</blockquote>

         Open Source Yoga advocates fight "Atom Bomb Balls" Bikram

We've blogged about Bikram the yogi blowhard before -- Mr. Choudhury has been making headlines over efforts to enforce copyright on a popular style of yoga he claims to have invented. He's been threatening to sue folks who teach them without permission (or licensing fees).

<p>
Now there are reports that a group called "Open Source Yoga Unity" has filed a suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, asking the judge to declare that Bikram cannot use his copyrights to stop others from practicing or teaching the Bikram sequence of poses.
<p>

Apart from the Bikram pose sequence, Mr. Chodhury is also famous for having uttered these words:
<p>
"Because I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me." 
<p>
"Bikram goes to the mat" -- <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-yogacase21mar21,0,2903327.story?coll=la-home-health">Link</a>. (<em>Thanks, Chris Maag, and eric</em>)

Daniel point us to a "Flash version of the live taping of 4th place winners of the 1979 Eurovision competition. The band is Dschingis Khan, the Germanization of Genghis Khan apparently, and the song is Moskau. Everyone is wearing shiny shimmering bright colors. There's a grinning, lanky, Santa-esque figure in red tights dancing like a madman at almost all times. I believe he is supposed to be the mighty Genghis. The two supporting female band members are of negligible interest, but the guys, oh man - when watching, pay attention to the bald blue one on the right and the bearded green one, they are chock full of hilarity."

        I love The Imaginary Foundation's t-shirts. The cut-up/collage designs seem to be rooted firmly in the surrealist and dada traditions. They're also really comfy. I inquired about the Foundation's operating principals and this is what I was told:

         Godwin's Law analog for porn and file-sharing
        </h3>
        Ed Felten pithily observes a corollary to Godwin's Law (which says that all online arguments end when someone gets compared to Hitler) for the copyfight: "As a copyright policy discussion grows longer, the probability of pornography being invoked approaches one. When the topic of a copyright policy discussion switches to pornography, each side suddenly adopts the other side's arguments."

<blockquote>
Hollywood argues that filesharing will lead to a shortage of movies, because nobody will make movies they can't sell. But when the topic switches to pornographic movies, suddenly they start arguing that filesharing increases the creation and availability of content.
<p>
Similarly, some P2P vendors who say they can't possibly filter or block copyrighted content, suddenly decide, when the topic switches to porn, that they can provide effective blocking.

<blockquote><strong>In a recent interview he described himself as an &#8220;ineffectual individual,&#8221; which is surprising for someone with such a prodigious output. Do you think he could survive without a woman like yourself in his life?</strong>
<br>No, he wouldn&#8217;t. He&#8217;d be dead without me. [Laughs.] When I met him his life was such a wreck. He&#8217;s really a soft guy. He just wants to be liked too much. When he says ineffectual, he just can&#8217;t say no to people. There are always parasites ready to jump on somebody like that. So I&#8217;m the bad cop.</blockquote>

        <h3>
         Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, a psychedelic tale
        </h3>
        A new BBC documentary posits that Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was inspired by the writer's own drug-induced hallucinations. At the time he wrote the book, Stevenson's tuberculosis was being treated with a derivative of ergot, a hallucinogenic fungus. Evidence comes from a letter uncovered in Yale University's Stevenson archive:

<blockquote>In the letter, dated &#8220;end of August, early September 1885&#8221;, Stevenson&#8217;s wife wrote to William Henley, her husband&#8217;s friend and literary agent: &#8220;Louis&#8217;s mad behaviour . . . I think it must be the ergotine that affects his brain at such time.<br><br>

&#8220;He is quite rational now, I am thankful to say, but he has just giving up insisting that he should be lifted into bed in a kneeling position, his face to the pillow.&#8221; </blockquote>

         In memoriam: Car designer John DeLorean
        </h3>
        Automobile developer John Z. DeLorean has died at age 80. 

<blockquote>
Hallmarks [of the DeLorean DMC-12], such as an unpainted stainless steel skin and the gull-wing doors, have been ignored by mainstream automakers. The angular design, however, earned it a cult following, and the car was a time-traveling vehicle for Michael J. Fox in the popular "Back to the Future" films of the late 1980s.

<p>
But the factory produced only about 8,900 cars in three years, estimated John Truscott, membership director of the DeLorean Owners Association. That figure is dwarfed by the major automakers, who sell more than a million vehicles a month. DeLorean's company collapsed in 1983, a year after he was arrested in Los Angeles and accused of conspiring to sell $24 million of cocaine to salvage his venture.

         Yahoo! bought Flickr!
        </h3>
        Yahoo! Flickr has been acquired by Yahoo! I'm an advisor to the company and I've been rooting for them through a long negotiation, and I'm so happy for them now that it's a done deal. Congrats, guys -- couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.

<blockquote>
What is going to happen to Flickr?<br>
Flickr will be continuing on the path it's on -- to Flickr 1.0 and beyond. We'll be working with a bunch of people that Totally Get Flickr and want to preserve the community and the flavor of what is here. We're going to grow and change, but we're in it for the long haul, with the same management and same team.
<p>
You're not going to become a bunch of suits?<br>
No, no, no! The precious DNA we've got -- that of the Ludicrew -- is on side and revving up for building Flickr. Having the team building out the team's vision for Flickr has been stressed as our number one priority, and keeping us around -- in spite of our wiseassery, tomfoolery and tendency to hoot spontaneously -- is crucial for preserving the Flickrness that is Flickr.  They're not going to replace any of us with suits, nor induce us to wear them. Lapel? I don't know what you mean.

<blockquote>

<img src="http://www.boingboing.net/images/hipcorner.gif" align="left" width="289" height="204">

This bizarre sibling of American rap made up of English, Mandarin, and Shanghainese (Shanghai dialect of Mandarin, a.k.a. my hometown dialect) just blew me away.  The sound is typically rap but the lyrics and topics have a very distinctive Chinese/Shanghainese spin.  The lyrics are jammed with "trash" words in different languages. Topics are typically social commentaries such as the track named "Made in Shanghai" that takes a shot at the Chinese youth's blind infatuation with foreign pop cultures (Japanese, Korean) but also has a good amount of softer topics about unrequited or lost love.  BBC has a good story about of the rapper named "Little Lion" -- <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4329531.stm">Link</a>.

         Cory's IT Conversations debate on Google Autolinks
        </h3>
        Last week, I did a phone interview with Denise Howell about the Google Autolinks "controversy," along with Robert Scoble and Marty Schwimmer from the Trademark Blog, for Denise Howell's new IT Conversations Internet radio show, "Sound Policy." The one-hour debate was quite lively -- you can download or stream it and see for yourself.


<blockquote>
But those who have been watching the Web long enough to remember see a resemblance between AutoLink and Microsoft's Smart Tags feature, an unpopular link-adding "enhancement" to Internet Explorer that never made it out of the starting gate. Many wonder too whether AutoLink demonstrates a shift in Google's "don't be evil" approach toward making search profitable. Does AutoLink do enough to make it clear to users which links were put there by the Web page author and which were added? Could AutoLink or something like it alter the meaning and intent of the original page? Don't Web authors have the right to have their work distributed as written? Don't Web users have the right to view material in their browser however they'd like, and can't developers make tools that help this process?

         Don't say 'blogger' to US Immigration

        Via Declan McCullagh's <a href="http://politechbot.com/">politech</a> list: <a href="http://www.c4i.org">William Knowles</a> writes about a Canadian blogger who claims he was harassed and strip-searched by US immigration officials when he told them his profession was "blogger." Snip: 


<blockquote>
This sounds like an unbelievable story, but it happened to Canadian blogger <a href="http://www.ensight.org/">Jeremy Wright</a> last week. As already <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=jeremy+wright">reported on quite a few blogs</a>, Jeremy was detained and interrogated by US Immigration when he arrived in New York last week for a meeting with <s>McGraw-Hill</s> (<em>Ed. note: an unnamed media company -- see update</em>) to discuss a great business opportunity for Jeremy in the area of blogging.</p>

<p>It appears that the immigration people simply did not believe that Jeremy could make a living as a blogger. And they gave him the third degree - including an humiliating strip search - as a result for some hours. And banned him from entering the US. Incredible. Jeremy wrote detailed commentary on his blog about his experience, but he's now pulled those posts (<a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/03/16/issues-with-immigration/">this post explains why</a>). While the details aren't yet clear on exactly why Jeremy had such an awful experience at the hands of the guardians of freedom and liberty (hard to get true irony here), this appears to be disgraceful behaviour on their part.</p>

<p>I met Jeremy in the US in January. <a href="http://www.nevon.net/nevon/2005/01/the_hobson_holt_1.html">Shel and I interviewed him for a podcast</a>. You couldn't meet a nicer and more honourable bloke! </blockquote>

        Houston's famed Beer Can House will undergo a much-needed rennovation thanks to a $125,000 grant from the city to the <a href="http://www.orangeshow.org">Orange Show Center for Visionary Art</a>, owners of the property. John Milkovisch, a retired employee of Southern Pacific Railroad, began decorating in 1968. From <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/TXHOUbeer.html">Roadside America</a>:

<blockquote>

Beer cans quickly became John's exclusive medium -- a convenient one, since John drank a lot of beer. He worked on the house for the next 18 years, incorporating a six-pack a day into its adornment -- roughly 39,000 cans. He linked pull-tabs into long streamers to make curtains that chimed when the wind blew. "This curtain idea is just one of those dreams in the back of my noodle," he explained at the time.<br><br>

"John thought beer cured everything," explained Mary, his wife, after John had died (in 1988).</blockquote>

         Young Frankenstein's Memoir
        </h3>
        That's /<em>FRAHHHN</em>-ken-steen/, of course. Newsweek's Brian Braiker did a really neat interview with film legend Gene Wilder, whose memoirs were just published. I can't wait to get my paws on the book. Newsweek's online feature includes links to video clips of five classic Wilder scenes (including a moment from Willy Wonka, shown below), and background on each. Snip from interview:



<blockquote>
<img src="http://www.boingboing.net/images/wonka_wilder.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="137">



Q: I didn’t realize that you had had a stem-cell transplant. Have you done any advocacy for more stem-cell research or are you staying out of that debate?
<br>A: I wasn’t a friend, but I was an acquaintance, of Chris Reeve, and we talked about it the last time I saw him, which was at the U.S. Open. The Bush administration has this—I don’t know what to call it—I’d like to say Neanderthal outlook about it. Generally, I don’t like it when actors get up and start preaching, but it’s something that should be obvious and it’s hard to speak with vehemence when you think that the people you’re addressing it to aren’t going to understand what you’re saying. I think it’s something Congress should take up.
<p>
Q: You write about this compulsion to pray you had when you were younger. What’s so fascinating about it is that you called the compulsion your “Demon” when ostensibly you were praying to God.
<br>A: Actually, I never thought of it as God. I didn’t know what to call it. I don’t believe in devils, but demons I do because everyone at one time or another has some kind of a demon, even if you call it by another name, that drives them. It came in March of my freshman year at the university in Iowa and it lasted a long time. I never knew when it was going to come or go. Every time I was happy it seemed to rear—well, I say his ugly head, but I don’t know if it was a he or a she.

This story describes a recent ruling by Canada's Supreme Court that the Quebec law banning yellow margarine should be upheld. This law is ostensibly to protect unsuspecting consumers who might otherwise be fooled into eating margarine in place of butter. And so, Quebeckers continue to eat white margarine.</blockquote>

         Gallery of Port Authority "photo prohibited" signs
        </h3>
        Karl sez,

<blockquote>
<img src="http://craphound.com/images/portauthoritynopix.jpg" width="209" height="203" align="left">
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has quietly banned the taking of photographs in at least the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, on the George Washington Bridge, and in the PATH system. (I've seen people being hassled for taking pictures inside the P.A. Bus Terminal, but I couldn't find that prohibited in the posted rules; they wised up at the World Trade Center site and I can't find any prohibitions there any more; I don't know what the status is at the airports, but I can't imagine it being good.)
<p>
When I first saw the slick signage at the Holland Tunnel, I was very sad. They have since added these "No Photo" signs on the GW and the Lincoln tunnel, and every time I see them, I feel a mixture of anger and helplessness and sadness. Soon enough, you just get used to it, and begin to forget that it ever was any different. "Why would you ever have wanted to take pictures inside a tunnel anyway, Grampa?"
<p>
It's sad and depressing, and I don't want it to become merely taken for granted and unremarked.
So I went out and took pictures of the "No Pictures" signs, and I've put them up on my website. They're not professional pictures, and a good zoom lense would have helped my effort enormously, but at least they're up, and maybe will cause people to stop and think about it for just a little bit.

Yo, NYT: if you don't like anonymous speech, relocate to some country without a First Amendment!
